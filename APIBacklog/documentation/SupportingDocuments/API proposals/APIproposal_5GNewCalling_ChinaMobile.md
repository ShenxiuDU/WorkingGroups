| API summary |Utilizing IMS Data Channel technology (specified in 3GPP TS 26.114, TS 23.228 and GSMA NG.134), 5G new calling introduces a richer feature set natively on the mobile device, such as interactive visual menu, content sharing and so on, to enhance the calling experience. The 5G New Calling API provides ability for Brand/Vertical service provider to establish 5G new calling communications with the other party (e.g. a subscriber of MNOs or a Vertical application client). <br><br>Here are two example use cases:<br>Use Case 1:<br>Enterprise Caller ID: Customer service Call Centre could initiate a 5G new calling to a customer through this API. During this 5G new calling, customer service staff could present enterprise’s business card to the consumers during the ringing phase. Consumer could click on the card for more details about the call, such as the identity of the customer service staff and the purpose of the call. This enhances user trust, improves the access rate and communication efficiency for enterprise.<br><br>Use Case 2:<br>Interactive calling: During a call with a consumer, the Brand/Vertical service provider could modify the call to 5G new calling through this API, after which the consumer will experience 5G new calling services. For example, the consumer could perform complex actions directly through the interactive visual menu, such as checking out the latest products, or could provide more complex information to Brand/Vertical service provider through image/file sharing. 5G new calling enables Brand/Vertical service provider increase communication efficiency and improve customer service experience.|
